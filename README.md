# Odisseus Raspberry Pi

This is my attempt to develop a four wheels multisensor robot in Raspberry Pi. There is also a simulation based on ROS which is in progress here: https://github.com/pockerman/odisseus_ros  

## Hardware

- 2 Wheels
- 2 DC motors
- A Pi camera
- An ultrasound sensor
- An IR sensor
- An L289N H-bridge

## Installation

Make sure that the raspberry pi used satisfies the  requirements in _requirements.txt_. 
All in all you need:

- **TODO**

## Start the Odisseus server



- ```python3 odisseus_web_app.py```
